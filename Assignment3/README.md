## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Things to know about the program

WHEN ENTERING UNITS YOU HAVE SPECIFIC OPTIONS

## How to use the program 

once you run the program it will prompt you to type in a positive number

it will then prompt you to give it the unit you want to convert it from.you have to press enter twice here for some reason that I havent figured out.

then it will prompt you to type in the unit you want to convert it to.

once this information is given it will print out the conversion for you and prompt you to continue or exit the program.

to exit the program you can type in "exit" or "-1" to the terminal and it will end the application.

to continue with another conversion, just press enter.
